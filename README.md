In this project we made atmega 328 to arduino uno using breadboard.
## Components required
atmega328,16mhz crystal,LED light, push button(used as reset buttton),capacitor,resistor,FTDI Serial convertor.
### Procedure
1.first connect all components as like in the arduino board,if you want circuit diagram then google it :)))
2.upload it using FTDI serial convertor
3.Burn the bootoader
3.upload the blink to test program to test the project
